# Constructive Criticism

We felt that the activities were nice and helpful, since it showed us how is the real world of the software industries and the different parts that conforms a project.
The activities that we consider that could be improved are the PDs, sometimes the requirements that the PD asked for were kind of confusing for some teammates, but even with all of that, the PDs are something necessary and are useful to employ the topics that were talked about on the class.
Some activities that we might suggest adding are that some day of the week, the class is organized in random teams, and are asked to make something about a topic of some class, or to discuss on an situation given by the professors, so it could improve the organization and communication of the students, so it helps them to improve their soft skills, since they are very important on the software industry and for working collaboratively in different kinds of scenarios.
