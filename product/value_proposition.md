## Propuesta de Valor

The value of the extension is that it will be linked to the Android operating system, and will be able to better manage notifications, since it will be in charge of emphasizing the things that the user would be interested in; such as personal, academic or professional aspects, and on the other hand, do not show those that do not interest you (spam). It will be a filter through different keywords that the user would personally enter based on their own tastes and criteria.

Another value that is added to the extension is that it will be able to display notifications in large format on the cell phone's lock screen.
