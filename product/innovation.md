- **The efficient email filtering capability:** 
  - The ability to organize specific emails based on a personalized search where the user can choose keywords related to their interests such as meetings, events, scholarships, or any other type of message they want to prioritize.
  
- **Notification customization:** 
  - Allows users to customize notifications to their individual preferences and needs, ensuring they don't miss any relevant informational messages and facilitating a better interaction.

The majority of these points might not be considered innovations, but we see them as such because by being able to focus on a specific community, in this case, the UADY students, we are innovating by enhancing these functions designed only for this user group. This allows us to provide better and more focused attention to the users.
