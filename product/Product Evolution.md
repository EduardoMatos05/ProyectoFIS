# Product Evolution

In this section, the evolution of the product is seen through the most relevant changes made from the first to the third delivery during the development of our project.

## First Delivery → Second Delivery

| Changes | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| The evaluation, refinement and description of the functional and non-functional requirements of the software. | - [Requirements Meeting](https://alumnosuady-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/a20201678_alumnos_uady_mx/Eb1QI9tDeN1KmUMv-QTzXJkB5PcP3dex-ydqEOx6acBRQQ?e=VKPil0)<br>- [Specifications List](https://alumnosuady-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/a20201678_alumnos_uady_mx/EZFFIG2df9hKuCqC534GU5kBR2fjqRtZVS5roDdb6fXd7w?e=o5WgET)<br>- [Usecase](https://github.com/EduardoMatos05/ProyectoFIS/blob/Pablo/other%20artifacts/usecase%20(2).png?raw=true)|
| Another great advance was the realization of the interfaces developed after consolidating the requirements. | - [Interfaces](https://github.com/EduardoMatos05/ProyectoFIS/blob/Eduardo/other%20artifacts/interfaces.png?raw=true)<br>- [Workspace in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/IBvMQLGx13mbhDdYmRxOet/UAY!?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=d29MJYJAjPiGZNTw-1) |
