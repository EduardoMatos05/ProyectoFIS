## Prioritization

Prioritization (MoSCoW Method)

To determine the priority of functional and non-functional requirements, we have chosen to use the MoSCoW method, which involves a series of Specifications to define the importance of each requirement:

Must have: These are of the utmost priority, as without these requirements, the system will not function.

Should have: These are the features that add significant value to the system and are a priority to consider.

Could have: These are ideas that may not be as essential but provide an extra edge to the project and are sufficiently relevant to include.

Won’t have: These are requirements that were considered earlier but have been set aside for now. However, they may be implemented in the future.

The idea is simple: prioritize the requirements efficiently and accurately. To determine the category in which functional and non-functional requirements should fall, a vote was conducted, with arguments made regarding which ones have the highest urgency/priority.

Finally, we have categorized the requirements as follows:

Must have:

1.-  The user will be able to manage their email by categories.


2.-  The system will prioritize notifications according to the keywords that the user
chooses.


3.- The system will be linked to outlook email app.


Should have:

1.- The user will be able to customize how to receive notifications.

2.- The system can be customized (appearance, sounds, backgrounds)

3.- The system will be compatible with most Android devices

4.- The system will not affect the efficiency of the device

Could have:

1.- The system will ask questions periodically to find out if the user wants to continue
filtering notifications from certain senders


2.- The user will have no limits on the number of keywords to enter.

Won’t have:

1.- The system can link with other apps (such as Facebook, etc.).
