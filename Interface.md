## Feedback and Suggestions

After the had the finished User Interfaces, we tested them on the users that the software is planned so we could receive the impressions, suggestions and criticism that the users had about the interfaces; the reason for this is because with the feedback received directly from the users, the User Interfaces could be adjusted to be more in line with what the they want, so when the Interfaces go from low to high fidelity they will be more easy to interact with.

The way we got the feedback was using a test format, so when we find a possible user, using Figma's prototypes tool we asked to do or search one of the software options, while we kept reports of if the user asked any questions, if he made mistakes, if he was comfortable with the interfaces, etc...

In the end, we asked them if they had any comments on the software, what did they thought  of the interfaces and in the case they did, what questions did they asked.

## Results

We worked with a total of 7 testers, and after giving them  an option to interact with on the software, we have the next results about the UI:

-   5  testers didn’t have an issue with them.
    
-   Neither of them  made a question related to the interfaces.
    
-   2 got confused by the interfaces.
    
-   Every one of them felt comfortable while using the interfaces.
    

We also had an average time of 1.69 minutes for the testers to find the option they were asked to use, and 3 testers had an issue with the UI.

## Feedback

After we ended the UI simulations, we asked the testers some questions about what they think about the interfaces and the software functionality, here’s the summary:

**What do they think about it?**

Most of the answers were positive, we got comments about that the UI was very intuitive and interactive, as well as the testers said that the emails were “Cleaner and more understandable.

**Do you have any comments about the software?**

Unlike the previous question, the testers had some comments and critics about the software; for the comments about the software, we can see that everyone agreed that the software was a great idea of filtering emails so one can see the emails that contains the information that the user has interest, but,  we received some critics about the HUD and the Back buttons, where some users felt like they needed to force their vision so they could understand what they were seeing, and for the Back buttons some testers felt that the button was very small, and sometimes they went back by accident.

**What can we Improve?**

Since the UI are still in a low fidelity phase, based on the comments and criticism we received we can say the functional and nonfunctional requirements were implemented correctly, the only real ssue being the size of some of the buttons for visibility, after the simulations were done, the testers kept trying out all the functions of the extension, and they find that it showed the emails in a more clearer way, also, that the idea of separating the emails by categories seems pretty useful to filter out all the mails that the testers get on their respective Outlook.
