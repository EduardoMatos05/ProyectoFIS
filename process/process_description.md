## Work Methodology

The work methodology we used is the Scrum methodology, because, since by promoting the self-organization and an equal rhythm, it acclimates to the project we are developing since by being partial tasks the activities and the advances becomes more dynamic and flexible.

## Description

Before we started working, as a team we organized by assigning tasks to each teammate, which everyone was going to be responsible by himself, this was done using a document created in Microsoft Word where it was explained the project organization and how everyone was going to work, also, we gave value to each task and the project’s tasks and progress was verified by using GitHub’s projects tab.

## Team Members Roles

 - Eduardo Matos: Product owner/Development team
 - Pablo Canto: Scrum master/Development team
 - Mauricio Dzay: Development team
 - Lexus Parra: Development team
 - Eduardo del Río: QA/Development team

## Tools
For the organization and making of the project we used the next tools:
 - *GitHub*
 - *WhatsApp*
 - *StackEdit*
 - *Microsoft Visual Studio Code*
 - *Microsoft Word*
 - *Excel*

 ## Second Delivery
 From the sprint that include the months of September-October, our team had to update the way that we were organising our tasks and activities, since it wasn't the most efficient way and it didn´t work as expected.

 As said in the last deliver, the working methodology that we used was the Scrum methodology, but in reality, we were organising ourselves based in the Scrum methodology, because even when we didn´t make the usual "Daily Scrum", we still considered the documentation that the methodology used for keeping the track of the project.

 ## Process Description
 Since the first delivery was made on September 30th, we started by correcting and adjusting some details in the team organization, the first adjust being the Sprint Backlog from the second delivery, after we were informed about what we needed to do, the tasks were assigned in a Word document.

 And as we started having weekly reunions with our professor, we started having weekly sprints where we showed him the project advance.

 The sprint backlogs and more documentation can be found at the end of this document.

## Team Member Roles
 For the team roles, we had an adjustment on what role will the team members have, resulting on the next list:

 - Eduardo Matos: Product owner
 - Pablo Canto: Scrum master
 - Mauricio Dzay: Development team
 - Lexus Parra: Development team
 - Eduardo del Río: Development team / QA
 - Rodrigo Alonzo: Development team
 - Braulio Cuevas: Development team

Where the development team members focused on the making of the project UI by using wireframes in Figma.

## Project Management
Like the first delivery, the next table will explain the activities that were needed to be made, the assignees, the deadline and the priority the activity had as well.

## Tools
We keep using the same tools that we used in the first delivery, with the addition of 2 more, being:
 - *Figma*
 - *Discord*

## Documents and Backlogs

Since we improved the organization of the team to be more formal by using a word document for each week, here is the list of all the documentation related to the organization from the second delivery:

 - [Product Backlog](https://alumnosuady-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/a20201678_alumnos_uady_mx/EWEwDBzRqb9Igm21H0HRjpABLZf9iXeZelMFbhAQ2iR1FA?e=W7FatE)

## Third Delivery
For the sprint that include the months of October-November, we focused on finishing the User Interfaces, making the simulations so we could get the feedback for the users and doing the necesary corrections on the repository.

## Description
For the team organization, we agreed on the tasks we will carry out using the group chat, we wrote down the tasks that are needed for the deliver, and each one wrote which task can they do.

After we all agreed on the tasks divition, we started working individually as we usually did on the other delivers, when someone made some progress they adviced on the group chat, so everyone on the team have a motion of each task.

## Tools

Since it´s the last update on the repository, the tools that we used during all the sprints in the end are the next ones:

 - *GitHub*
 - *WhatsApp*

 As our principal channel of communication, we made a gruop chat were we only posted what tasks are needed for the deliver, who is going to be the asignee, and more related to the organization for the delivers, also the team agreed on everytime a progress was made, it was notified to all the teams so everyone could check it out and give their respective opinions.
 - *StackEdit*
 - *Microsoft Visual Studio Code*
 - *Microsoft Word*
 - *Excel*

 We used excel to help us with the individual metrics, the tasks were given a value, so by using it we had a control on the total contribution of each team member.
 - *Figma*
 - *Discord*

 Even though it wasn't the principal communication method, sometimes we required to realize meetings about the project advances and organization, we used this tool instead of others like Microsoft Teams because every team member felt more comfortable using it, and it was used when a great part of the team didn't understand something about the project or when we needed to clarify something.

 ## Team members roles
 Since we didn´t make any changes on the team´s roles, they stayed the same as the last deliver:

 - Eduardo Matos: Product owner
 - Pablo Canto: Scrum master
 - Mauricio Dzay: Development team
 - Lexus Parra: Development team
 - Eduardo del Río: Development team / QA
 - Rodrigo Alonzo: Development team
 - Braulio Cuevas: Development team

 ## Project Management

 On the next table, as same as the deliveries before this one, it will explain the activities that were realized on the sprint, with their respective asignee, start date, end date, endline and priority.

 As shown on the table, there might be some time discrepancies between some tasks, this happened due to an endline extention, as well as some tasks were added to the deliver, so the video and presentation also had to be edited to include the new information.
