## Work Methodology

The work methodology we used is the Scrum methodology, because, since by promoting the self-organization and an equal rhythm, it acclimates to the project we are developing since by being partial tasks the activities and the advances becomes more dynamic and flexible.

## Description

Before we started working, as a team we organized by assigning tasks to each teammate, which everyone was going to be responsible by himself, this was done using a document created in Microsoft Word where it was explained the project organization and how everyone was going to work, also, we gave value to each task and the project’s tasks and progress was verified by using GitHub’s projects tab.

## Tools
For the organization and making of the project we used the next tools:
 - *GitHub*
 - *WhatsApp*
 - *StackEdit*
 - *Microsoft Visual Studio Code*
 - *Microsoft Word*
 - *Excel*

 ## Second Delivery
 From the sprint that include the months of September-October, our team had to update the way that we were organising our tasks and activities, since it wasn't the most efficient way and didn´t work as expected.

 As said in the last deliver, the working methodology that we used was the Scrum methodology, but in reality, we were organising ourselfs based in the Scrum methodology, because even when we didn´t make the usual "Daily Scrum", we still considered the documentation that the methodology used for keeping the track of the project.

 ## Process Description
 Since the first delivery was made on September 30th, we started by correcting and adjusting some details in the team organization, the first adjust being the Sprint Backlog from the second delivery, after we were informed about what we needed to do, the tasks were assigned in a Word going next, that you can found down below.

 And as we started having weekly reunions with our professor, we started having weekly sprints that we showed to him to show the project advance, the weekly sprints backlogs are found also down below.

## Team Member Roles
 For the team roles, we had an adjustment on what role will the team members have, resulting on the next list:

 - Eduardo Matos: Product owner
 - Pablo Canto: Scrum master
 - Mauricio Dzay: Development team
 - Lexus Parra: Development team
 - Eduardo del Río: Development team / QA
 - Rodrigo Alonzo: Development team
 - Braulio Cuevas: Development team

Where the development team members focused on the making of the project UI by using wireframes in Figma.
