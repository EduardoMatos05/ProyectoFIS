# Contribution metric

For the purpose of metrics, the tasks that had to be completed for the Third Delivery were scored according to the amount of effort required to complete them. They were scored on a scale from 1 to 3, with 1 representing a simple task, 2 representing an intermediate task and 3 representing a demanding task, for a total of 41 points. Some tasks were divided in half, and the scoring was adjusted accordingly. The goal was for team members was to achieve an average of 5 individual points out of the total 41. If not, the team member would be required to contribute extra in the following objectives, activity, or subsequent development stage.
